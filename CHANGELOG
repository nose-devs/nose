0.10.0

- Fixed bug that broke plugins with names containing underscores or
  hyphens. Thanks to John J Lee for the bug report and patch (Issue
  #81).
- Fixed typo in nose.__all__. Thanks to John J Lee for the bug report.
- Fixed handling of test descriptions that are multiline
  docstrings. Thanks to James Casbon for the patch (Issue #50).
- Improved documentation of doctest plugin to make it clear that
  entities may have doctests, or themselves be tests, but not
  both. Thanks to John J Lee for the bug report and patch (Issue #84).

0.10.0b1

- Added support for a description attribute on tests in function and
  method test cases.  Most useful for generators: set the description
  attribute on the yielded function.
- Fixed incorrect signature of addSuccess() method in
  IPluginInterface. Thanks to nosexunit for the bug report. (Issue
  #68).
- Fixed isclass() function in nose.util so that it will not raise an
  exception when examining instances that have no accessible __bases__
  attribute. (Issue #65).
- Fixed passing of tests to result; the test itself and not the
  wrapper was being passed, resulting in test description plugin hooks
  not being called. (Issue #71).
- Fixed bugs in FailureDetail and Capture plugins, and plugin manager
  and proxy uses of chainable plugin calls. Thanks to Ian Bicking for
  the bug report (Issue #72).
- Improved documentation.

0.10.0a2

- Changed entry point name to nose.plugins.0.10 -- dashes and other
  non-word characters besides . are not allowed in entry point names.
  (Issue #67)
- Fixed loading of plugins from that entry point.
- Fixed backwards-compatibility issue in nose.util (is_generator was
  renamed isgenerator). (Issue #64)
- Fixed bug in --logging-config option. Thanks to anton_kr... at yahoo
  com for the bug report. (Issue #62)
- Fixed bug in handling of --where argument: first --where was not
  passed to loader as workingDir. Thanks to nosexunit for the bug
  report. (Issue #63).

0.10.0a1

- Rewrote test loader to be more drop-in compatible with
  unittest.TestLoader and to support a more user-friendly command
  line.
- Rewrote test runner and result classes to reduce duplication of effort.
- Revised configuration system to be less convoluted.
- Added nose.case.TestCase as universal wrapper for all
  testcases. Plugins always see instances of this class.
- Added a management layer to the plugin system, allowing for easy use
  of different plugin loading schemes. The default manager loads
  builtin plugins, 0.10 plugins under the setuptools entrypoint
  nose.plugins.0-10 and provides limited support for legacy plugins
  loaded under the entrypoint nose.plugins.
- Added plugin hooks in all phases of discovery, running and description.
- Converted several formely core features to plugins: output capture,
  assert introspection, pdb, and skipped and deprecated test support.
- Added id plugin that allows for easier specification of tests on the
  command line.
- Added ErrorClassPlugin base class to allow for easier authoring of
  plugins that handle errors, like the builtin skipped and deprecated
  test plugins.
- Added support for loading doctests from non-module files for all
  supported python versions.
- Added score property to plugins to allow plugins to execute in a
  defined order (higher score execute first).
- Expanded nose's own test suite to include a variety of functional tests.
- Fixed many bugs.

0.9.3

- Added support for user configuration files. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou for the
  patch.
- Fixed bug that caused profiler plugin to leak 0-byte temp files. Thanks to
  Antoine Pitrou for the patch.
- Made usage of temp files in profiler plugin more sensible. Thanks to Michael
  Sclenker for the bug report.
- Fixed bug that stopped loading of twisted TestCase tests. Thanks to Kumar
  McMillan for the bug report.
- Corrected man page location. Thanks to luke macken for the bug report and
  patch.
- Added with_setup to nose.tools.__all__. Thanks to Allen Bierbaum for the bug
  report.
- Altered plugin loading so that builtin plugins can be loaded without
  setuptools. Thanks to Allen Bierbaum for the suggestion.
- Fixed a bug in the doctests plugin that caused an error when multiple
  exclude arguments were specified. Thanks to mbeachy for the bug report and
  patch.

- Added nosetests setuptools command. Now you can run python setup.py
  nosetests and have access to all nose features and plugins. Thanks to James
  Casbon for the patch.
- Added make_decorator function to nose.tools. Used to construct decorator
  functions that are well-behaved and preserve as much of the original
  function's metadata as possible. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou for the patch.
- Added nose.twistedtools, contributed by Antoine Pitrou. This module adds
  @deferred decorator that makes it simple to write deferred tests, with or
  without timeouts.
- Added monkeypatch to doctests that keeps doctest from stepping on coverage 
  when the two plugins are used together. Thanks to David Avraamides for the 
  bug report.
- Added isolation plugin. Use this plugin to automatically restore sys.modules
  after each test module or package. Thanks to Michal Kwiatkowski for the 
  feature request.
- Fixed bug where -vvvv turned off verbose logging instead of making it even 
  more verbose. Thanks to Ian Bicking for the bug report.
- Fixed bug where assert inspection would fail when the trailing """ of a 
  docstring was one of the inspected lines. Thanks to cito at online dot de 
  for the bug report.
- Updated attrib plugin to allow selection of test methods by attributes of
  the test case class. Thanks to Jason Hildebrand for the patch.
- Improved compatibility with python 2.2. Thanks to Chad Whitacre for the 
  patch.
- Fixed bug in handling of options from setup.cfg. Thanks to Kumar McMillan for
  the patch.
- Fixed bug in generator methods, where a generator method using an inline
  funciton would result in an AttributeError. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou for the
  bug report.
- Updated coverage plugin to ignore lines tagged with #pragma: no cover, 
  matching the behavior of coverage.py on the command line. Thanks to Bill 
  Zingler for the bug report.
- Added a man page for nosetests. Thanks to Gustavo Noronha Silva for the 
  request and providing an example.

0.9.1

- New function nose.runmodule() finds and runs tests only in a 
  single module, which defaults to __main__ (like unittest.main() or 
  doctest.runmodule()). Thanks Greg Wilson for the suggestion.
- Multiple -w (--where) arguments can now be used in one command line,
  to find and run tests in multiple locations. Thanks Titus Brown for
  the suggestion.
- Multiple --include and --exclude arguments are now accepted in one command 
  line. Thanks Michal Kwiatkowski for the feature request.
- Coverage will now include modules not imported by any test when
  using the new --cover-inclusive switch. Thanks James Casbon for the
  patch.
- module:TestClass test selections now properly select all tests in the test 
  class.
- startTest and stopTest are now called in plugins at the beginning and end of
  test suites, including test modules, as well as individual tests. Thanks 
  Michal Kwiatkowski for the suggestion.
- Fix bug in test selection when run as ``python setup.py test``: 'test' was 
  passing through and being used as the test name selection. Thanks Kumar 
  McMillan for the bug report.
- Fix bug in handling of -x/--stop option where the test run would stop on
  skipped or deprecated tests. Thanks Kumar McMillan for the bug report.
- Fix bug in loading tests from projects with layouts that place modules in
  /lib or /src dirs and tests in a parallel /tests dir.
- Fix bug in python version detection. Thanks Kevin Dangoor for the bug report 
  and fix.
- Fix log message in selector that could raise IndexError. Thanks Kumar 
  McMillan for the bug report and patch.
- Fix bug in handling doctest extension arguments specified in environment and
  on command line. Thanks Ian Bicking for the bug report.
- Fix bug in running fixtures (setup/teardown) that are not functions, and
  report a better error message when a fixture is not callable. Thanks Ian
  Bicking for the bug report.
  
0.9.0

- More unit tests and better test coverage. Numerous bugfixes deriving from
  same.
- Make --exe option do what it says, and turn it on by default on
  Windows. Add --noexe option so windows users can turn if off.Thanks
  richard at artsalliancemedia dot com for the bug reports.  
- Handle a working directory that happens to be in the middle of a package
  more gracefully. Thanks Max Ischenko for the bug report and test case.
- Fix bugs in test name comparison when a test module is specified whose name
  overlaps that of a non-test module. Thanks Max Ischenko for the bug report
  and test case.
- Fix warning spam when a non-existent test file is requested on the command
  line. Thanks Max Ischenko for the bug report.

0.9.0b2

  for the patch.

0.9.0b1

- Fix bug in handling of OR conditions in attrib plugin. Thanks to Titus
  Brown for the bug report.
- Fix bug in nose.importer that would cause an attribute error when a local
  module shadowed a builtin, or other object in sys.modules, without a
  __file__ attribute. Thanks to casbon at gmail dot com for the bug report.
- Fix bug in nose.tools decorators that would cause decorated tests to appear
  with incorrect names in result output.   

0.9.0a2

- In TestLoader, use inspect's isfunction() and ismethod() to filter functions
  and methods, instead of callable(). Thanks to Kumar McMillan for reporting
  the bug.
- Fix doctest plugin: return an empty iterable when no tests are found in a
  directory instead of None. Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report and
  patch.
- Ignore executable python modules, unless run with --exe file. This is a
  partial defense against nose causing trouble by loading python modules that
  are not import-safe. The full defense: don't write modules that aren't
  import safe!
- Catch and warn about errors on plugin load instead of dying.
- Renamed builtin profile module from nose.plugins.profile to
  nose.plugins.prof to avoid shadowing stdlib profile.py module.

0.9.0a1

- Add support for plugins, with hooks for selecting, loading and reporting on
  tests. Doctest and coverage are now plugins.
- Add builtin plugins for profiling with hotshot, selecting tests by
  attribute (contributed by Mika Eloranta), and warning of missed tests
  specified on command line.

- Reimplement test loading as unittest-compatible TestLoader class.
- Remove all monkeypatching.
- Reimplement output capture and assert introspection support in
  unittest-compatible Result class.
- Better support for multiline constructions in assert introspection.
- More context output with assert introspections.
- Refactor setuptools test command support to use proxied result, which
  enables output capture and assert introspection support without
  monkeypatching. Thanks to Philip J. Eby for the suggestion and skeleton
  implementation.
- Add support for generators in test classes. Thanks to Jay Parlar for the
  suggestion and patch.
- Add nose.tools package with some helpful test-composition functions and
  decorators, including @raises, contributed by Scot Doyle.
- Reimplement nose.main (TestProgram) to have unittest-compatible signature.
- All-new import path handling. You can even turn it off! (If you don't,
  nose will ensure that all directories from which it imports anything are on
  sys.path before the import.)
- Logging package used for verbose logging.
- Support for skipped and deprecated tests.
- Configuration is no longer global.

0.8.7

- Add support for py.test-style test generators. Thanks to Jay Parlar for
  the suggestion.
- Fix bug in doctest discovery. Thanks to Richard Cooper for the bug report.
- Fix bug in output capture being appended to later exceptions. Thanks to
  Titus Brown for the patch that uncovered the bug.
- Fix bug(?) in Exception patch that caused masked hasattr/__getattr__ loops
  to either become actual infinite loops, or at least take so long to finally
  error out that they might as well be infinite.
- Add -m option to restrict test running to only tests in a particular package
  or module. Like the -f option, -m does not restrict test *loading*, only
  test *execution*.
- When loading and running a test module, ensure that the module's path is in
  sys.path for the duration of the run, not just while importing the module.
- Add id() method to all callable test classes, for greater unittest
  compatibility.
  
0.8.6

- Fix bug with coverage output when sys.modules contains entries without
  __file__ attributes
- Added -p (--cover-packages) switch that may be used to restrict coverage
  report to modules in the indicated package(s)

0.8.5

- Output capture and verbose assertion errors now work when run like
  'python setup.py test', as advertised.
- Code coverage improvements: now coverage will be output for all modules
  imported by any means that were not in sys.modules at the start of the test
  run. By default, test modules will be excluded from the coverage report, but
  you can include them with the -t (--cover-tests) option.

0.8.4

- Fix bugs in handling of setup/teardown fixtures that could cause TypeError
  exceptions in fixtures to be silently ignored, or multiple fixtures of the
  same type to run. Thanks to Titus Brown for the bug report.

0.8.3

- Add -V (--version) switch to nosetests
- Fix bug where sys.path would not be set up correctly when running some
  tests, producing spurious import errors (Thanks to Titus Brown and Mike
  Thomson for the bug reports)
- For test classses not derived from unittest.TestCase, output (module.Class)
  "doc string" as test description, when method doc string is available
  (Thanks to David Keeney for the suggestion, even if this isn't quite what he
  meant)

0.8.2

- Revise import to bypass sys.path and manipulate sys.modules more
  intelligently, ensuring that the test module we think we are loading is the
  module we actually load, and that modules loaded by other imports are not
  reloaded without cause
- Allow test directories inside of packages. Formerly directories matching
  testMatch but lacking an __init__.py would cause an ImportError when located
  inside of packages
- Fix bugs in different handling of -f switch in combination with -w and -o

0.8.1

- Fix bug in main() that resulted in incorrect exit status for nosetests
  script when tests fail
- Add missing test files to MANIFEST.in
- Miscellaneous pylint cleanups

0.8

- Add doctest support
- Add optional code coverage support, using Ned Batchelder's coverage.py;
  activate with --coverage switch or NOSE_COVERAGE environment variable
- More informative error message on import error 
- Fix bug where module setup could be called twice and teardown skipped
  for certain setup method names.
- main() returns success value, does not exit. run_exit() added to support
  old behavior; nosetests script now calls nose.run_exit()
 
0.7.5

- Fix bus error on exit
- Discover tests inside of non-TestCase classes that match testMatch
- Reorganize selftest: now selftest tests the output of a full nose run
- Add test_with_setup.py contributed by Kumar McMillan
 
0.7.2

- Refactor and correct bugs in discovery and test loading
- Reorganize and expand documentation
- Add -f (run this test file only) switch

  stripped of file extension before import.
  
0.7

- Change license to LGPL
- Major rework of output capture and assert introspection
- Improve test discovery: now finds tests in packages
- Replace -n switch ('no cwd') with -w switch ('look here')

0.6

- New nosetests script
- Allow specification of names on command line that are loadable but not
  directly loadable as modules (eg nosetests -o path/to/tests.py)
- Add optional py.test-like assert introspection. Thanks to Kevin Dangoor
  for the suggestion.
- Improvements to selftest
 
0.5.1

- Increased compatibility with python 2.3 (and maybe earlier)
